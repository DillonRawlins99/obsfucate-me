# Obsfucate Me, A Learning Project In Binary Encodings, Teletypes
## TLDR 
TODO
## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of binary
- Basic digital literacy
## Introduction
> There are 10 kinds of people in the world-those who understand binary and those who don't.

What a binary sequence means is in the eye of the beholder. It could be interpreted to be a sequence of answers to yes/no questions, an image of your cat, an [ELF executable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format), an [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family) instruction or the text of ["Great Expectations"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Expectations). The key is to agree on the format and structure of the binary for the type of information you are representing.

[ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) maps bit patterns to character symbols. That gives one the capability to process, store, and transmit English written language (such as the text of Great Expectations) or a programming language's source code.

Moreover, beyond just [printable characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_character), ASCII has a legacy of control functions that were intended for [teletypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter) known as [control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character).
