# Obsfucate Me, A Learning Project In Binary Encodings, Teletypes
## TLDR 
TODO
## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of binary
## Introduction
> There are 10 kinds of people in the world-those who understand binary and those who don't.

What a binary sequence means is in the eye of the beholder. It could be interpreted to be a sequence of answes to yes/no question, an image of your cat, an [ELF executable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format), or the text of ["Great Expectations"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Expectations). The key is to just agree on the format and structure of the binary.

## Fundamental Concepts and Context
